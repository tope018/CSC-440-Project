# CSC440 Project Week 1 Report

* Timespan: 10/18/2017 - 10/25/2017
* Submitted: 10/25/2017
* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tope018/CSC-440-Project)

## Team Name: Redbeard

## Team Members: Nick Tope, Eric Spahr, Katie Bolen

## Week One Overview

During the first week, our team agreed to work on finishing the homeworks so we can focus our full time on completing our deadlines for each stage. Our team set up a Trello Board for team commnication and a Github repo for hosting our project files. During the course of the next week, we will begin work on Stage D.

## Expectations A-D

* D Stage - This stage appears quite easy. Basically just reading documentation and learning/reviewing python and flask. We will be rotating team leader due to time constraints of team members. 

* C Stage - This stage will most likely take the longest time. While not necessarily harder than the other stages, it requires a lot of time commitment to learn the Wiki structure and reverse engineer it using RESTful API. However, this stage will be most beneficial as we will learn a new knowledge management system to use in the future.

* B Stage - This stage will revitalize moral for the project. After spending lots of time learning languages and Wiki, we finally get to use creativity to develop an extension for out Wiki system.

* A Stage - This stage should take the shortest amount of time, as it should just be a python script to manipulate the Wiki system and database. 

## Time Measurement

D Stage - One Week [10/25/2017 - 11/1/2017]

C Stage - Two Weeks [11/1/2017 - 11/15/2017]

B Stage - One Week [11/15/2017 - 11/22/2017]

A Stage - One Week [11/22/2017 - 11/29/2017]

## Skill Level

Everyone on the team has a relatively close skill level. Each of us has taken a Python class, used continuous integration, and worked on adding additional implementations to a team project. Individual skill should cause problems with the deadlines of the project.
